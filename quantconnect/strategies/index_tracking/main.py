"""The lean engine is a piplin of pluggable models. Each model answers one responsibility 
(what symbols to consider, what signals to produce, how to turn signals into positions, how to 
place orders, how to apply risk/fees, etc.).

You wire up the models in initialize() (or rely on the framework defaults). The engine calls them 
in a defined order so the algorithm can make decisions from top (universe/alpha) to bottom (execution).

Example of a model driven pipleine:
- UniverseSelectionModel: defines the securities to consider (e.g. ETF constituents)
- AlphaModel (or any code that generates signals/insights): produces signals on what to do
- PortfolioConstructionModel: converts signals/insights into portfolio targets objects
- ExecutionModel (optional if you will use the algorithm's own order calls, but normally set to 
control how targets become orders)

The models are called in the following order:
1. UniverseSelectionModel: called when the universe needs to be updated (e.g. daily, monthly, etc.)
2. AlphaModel: called on every new data slice (e.g. every minute, second, etc.)
3. PortfolioConstructionModel: called after the AlphaModel, to convert insights into portfolio targets
4. ExecutionModel: called after the PortfolioConstructionModel, to convert portfolio targets into orders

HIGH LEVEL: 
1. Engine instantiates your QCAlgorithm subclass (e.g., EquityETFBeta).
2. Calls initialize() once so you can configure the algorithm.
3. Enters the main loop (backtest replay or live streaming). On each data update the engine:
    - Updates subscriptions/universe (calls universe models when needed)
    - Calls alpha/risk/portfolio/execution pipeline as appropriate
    - Calls OnData (and other event hooks) for your algorithm
4. Calls end-of-day / end-of-algorithm shutdown hooks when appropriate and then stops.

LIFECYCLE HOOKS:
- initialize(self)
    - Called once at the start to set up the algorithm (dates, cash, models, etc.)
    - Purpose: register securites (add_equity), set start/end dates/cash/brokerage, and register
    models (set_universe_selection, add_alpha, set_portfolio_construction, set_execution, etc.)
    - Do heavy setup here -- nothing else runs until this completes.
- on_data(self, slice)
    - Called repeatedly whenever new data arrives (per bar or tick depending on Resolution). Recieves
    a Slice containing all current subscriptions' data.
    - Purpose:  inspect incoming data, update custom indicators, place manual orders if your arent 
    using the model pipline. When you use the model pipeline, you rearely place raw orders here, 
    models handle that.
- on_secturites_changed(self, changes)
    - Called whenever the universe changes (securities added/removed). Recieves a SecurityChanges 
    object with lists of added and removed securities.
    - Purpose: inspect changes, initialize custom data structures/indicators for new securities, 
    clean up resources for removed securities.
- on_order_event(self, order_event)
    - Called whenever an order's status changes (submitted, filled, cancelled, etc.). Recieves an 
    OrderEvent object with details about the order change.
    - Purpose: track order status, implement custom order handling logic (e.g., logging, notifications).
- on_end_of_day(self, symbol)
    - Called at the end of each trading day for each security. Recieves the security's symbol.
    - Purpose: perform end-of-day processing (e.g., logging, custom indicator updates).
