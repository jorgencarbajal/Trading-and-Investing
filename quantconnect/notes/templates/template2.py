"""
This QuantConnect algorithm implements a simple momentum-based trading strategy for the SPY ETF using daily resolution 
data in raw normalization mode. It runs a backtest from January 1, 2020, to January 1, 2021, starting with $100,000 
in cash, using Interactive Brokers as the brokerage model with a margin account, and benchmarks performance against SPY. 
The strategy includes a 1-day warm-up period to preload data and avoids trading until after a 31-day cooldown period 
following each exit.

Here's a step-by-step description of the strategy's logic, executed on each new data slice (at the end of each daily 
bar):

1. Check for Valid Data: The algorithm first verifies if SPY data is available in the current data slice. If not, 
it logs a message and skips the rest of the logic to prevent errors.

2. Retrieve Current Price: It fetches the closing price of SPY from the data slice.

3. Entry Condition (Buy if Not Invested and Cooldown Expired): If the portfolio is not currently invested (no holdings) 
and the current time is at or after the next allowed entry time (initially set to the algorithm's start time):
   - Invest 100% of the portfolio in SPY using the set_holdings method.
   - Log the buy action with the current price.
   - Record the entry price for future exit calculations.

4. Exit Condition (Sell on 10% Gain or Loss): If the portfolio is invested and the current price has moved 
significantly from the entry priceâ€”specifically, if it's risen by 10% (current price > entry price * 1.1) or fallen 
by 10% (current price < entry price * 0.9):
   - Liquidate all holdings in SPY.
   - Log the sell action with the current price.
   - Set the next entry time to the current time plus a 31-day holding/cooldown period, preventing immediate re-entry.

This cycle repeats, effectively buying SPY after any cooldown, holding until a 10% profit target or stop-loss is hit, 
then selling and waiting 31 days before potentially re-entering. The strategy does not include advanced risk management, 
indicators, or multi-asset logic beyond SPY.
